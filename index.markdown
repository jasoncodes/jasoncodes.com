Oh, Hi. I didn't see you there.

You'll find any code I've published in my <a href="http://github.com/jasoncodes" rel="me">GitHub repositories</a>
(with anything interesting or useful I've found during my travels in my [watch list][github-watch]).

I expect an actual blog to turn up here eventually. (Ah, laziness. Where would I be without it?).
Until such time, you can find my random comments and retweets on various happenings in my <a href="http://twitter.com/jasoncodes" rel="me">twitter stream</a>.
